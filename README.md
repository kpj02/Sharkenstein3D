# Sharkenstein3D
A game written as a part of the course TDDC76 at Liu, using C++ together with SFML.  

The game was written by a group of six people during november and early december 2023. My area of responsibility was mainly the raycasting responsible for the rendering of the walls, floors and ceiling.  

For an example of how the game plays watch the video below!
